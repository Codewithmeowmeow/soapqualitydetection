# 🧼 Soap Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This beginner-friendly machine learning project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the quality of soap based on features such as pH, moisture, viscosity, color level, and fragrance level.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The goal is to build a classification model that can determine whether a soap sample is of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** quality using lab-measured features.

## 🧪 Features Used

- `pH`
- `Moisture`
- `Viscosity`
- `Color_Level`
- `Fragrance_Level`

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Random Forest Classifier** from scikit-learn
- Trained using a simple randomly generated dataset
- Accuracy may vary depending on the data

## 📈 Results

- Accuracy: *0.2* (on synthetic data — for demonstration purposes)
- Predicts quality category of new soap samples

## 📂 Project Structure


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install required packages:

2. Open the notebook:

3. Run the cells one by one to:
- Generate the dataset
- Train the model
- Predict new samples
